Mybatis is a popular open-source framework specifically designed to simplify interacting with relational databases in Java applications. It acts as an alternative to traditional methods like raw JDBC or even full-fledged ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like Hibernate.

Here's how Mybatis functions:

**Core Concept: Mapping SQL to Objects**

* Mybatis avoids complex object-relational mapping. Instead, it focuses on mapping the logic between SQL statements written for your relational database and objects in your Java code.

**Configuration Files or Annotations:**

* You define the mappings between SQL queries and Java objects using either XML configuration files or annotations. These configurations specify how data retrieved from the database should be populated into your Java objects and vice versa.

**Benefits of Mybatis:**

* **Simpler and More Control Over SQL:**  Compared to full ORMs, Mybatis gives you more control over the exact SQL statements being executed. This can be beneficial for performance optimization or complex queries.
* **Lightweight and Flexible:**  Mybatis is a smaller framework compared to ORMs, making it a good choice for projects that value a simpler approach.
* **Reduced Boilerplate Code:**  Mybatis handles repetitive tasks like setting up connections, parsing results, and handling exceptions, saving you coding time.

**How Mybatis Interacts with the Database:**

1. **Define Mappers:**  You create interfaces (mappers) in your Java code that represent the database interactions you need. These interfaces define methods with annotations specifying the corresponding SQL statements for each operation (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).

2. **Mybatis Session:**  Your application interacts with the database through a Mybatis session object. This session manages connections, prepared statements, and execution of the SQL queries defined in your mappers.

3. **Executing Queries:**  When you call a method on a mapper interface, Mybatis translates it into the corresponding SQL statement based on the annotations. It then executes the query on the database and retrieves the results.

4. **Mapping Results:**  Mybatis maps the retrieved data from the database into objects of your desired Java class. This mapping process relies on the configurations you defined earlier.

5. **Returning Results:**  Mybatis returns the populated Java objects back to your application code, allowing you to work with the data in a familiar object-oriented manner.

**In Summary:**

Mybatis offers a balance between control and simplicity for database interaction in Java. It's a good choice if you prefer writing your own SQL statements but want to avoid the boilerplate code associated with raw JDBC.
