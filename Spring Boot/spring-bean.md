A Spring bean is essentially any object that's managed by the Spring IoC container.  This management involves the entire lifecycle of the object, including:

* **Instantiation:** The container creates an instance of the bean's class.
* **Configuration:** The container injects any dependencies the bean requires (other beans) and sets any bean properties based on the configuration.
* **Lifecycle Management:** The container ensures the bean is properly initialized and destroyed when the application starts and stops, respectively.

**Key characteristics of a Spring bean:**

* **Reusable:**  Beans are singletons by default, meaning the container creates a single instance and provides it to any part of the application that needs it. You can configure beans to have different scopes (prototype for multiple instances) for specific use cases.
* **Configurable:**  You define how a bean is created and configured through annotations or configuration files. This allows for flexibility and customization.
* **Dependency Injection:** Beans don't create their own dependencies; the container injects them, promoting loose coupling and testability.

**Now, if you don't use `@Bean`, an object can still technically exist in your application, but it wouldn't be considered a Spring bean.**  Here's the difference:

* **Plain Java Object:**  An object you create manually wouldn't be managed by Spring. You'd be responsible for its entire lifecycle, including instantiation, configuration, and dependency management. This approach can be cumbersome and error-prone for complex applications.
* **Spring Bean:**  When you use `@Bean` or stereotype annotations like `@Service` or `@Repository`, you're essentially telling Spring to take over the object's lifecycle management. This allows you to focus on the object's core functionality and leverage Spring's features for dependency injection and configuration.

**In summary, Spring beans are managed objects that benefit from the Spring container's lifecycle management, dependency injection, and other features. While you can have plain Java objects without `@Bean`, it offers less control and flexibility compared to Spring-managed beans.**
